# Plan 17/01

Outcasts:
* Analyse the time evolution of the disintegration of the network, track connected components through time. heatmap with component sizes on 1 axis, time on the other, colour indicates frequency density.
* Look at bigger jumps than 1.
* Look at the evolution of the entropy of the largest connected component with time.

Preacher: 
* Produce stationary state plots (fig. 3), all 4 structures, runs of 10^6, ensembles of 50, 50 values of beta.
* Produce heatmaps of stationary state, all 4 structures, runs of 10^6, ensembles of 50 (if possible), 10x10(x10) values of beta, p(, q).
* Look at bigger jumps than 1.
