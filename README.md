# MSci Project on Higher-order Social Dynamics

**Current capabilities**

Given a time-resolved edge list:
* Simulate the higher order naming game using the "unanimous rule"
* Supports committed agents
* Supports multiple (>2) opinions/names

**Next steps**
* Include support for more rules, not just unanimous
* Include a measure of social influence exhibited by each agent
* Rewrite in object-oriented form - requires digging through documentation
* Refine what one timestep involves, look at "Group interactions modulate critical mass dynamics in social convention" [link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-00845-y)
